          <h2>Rory Stouder</h2>
          <p>Working as a CNC shift supervisor, I interacted with computers and people everyday. I found I had a love for understanding technology, and what drives it, I wanted to learn more. I decided to go back to school to earn my degree. Information technology being the best choice for my skills. I have many interests in information technology, centered around project design and management. Information technology is the vital backbone of world wide commerce.

Make suggestions for ways to improve services as new technology becomes available. I have the skills to oversee installations. Oversee upgrades that will enhance operations. When customers make special requests, I can discern the proper resources needed. Determine if we can meet these needs, and offer solutions based on those evaluations.</p>

          <p>I will supervise the staff and handle the administrative duties. Creating and updating reports, creating schedules and assigning tasks. I have experience training new staff members. I can make presentations on the products we sell.</p>

          <p>The experience of working with vendors and customers gives me the skills needed. To find solutions to the root cause. Determine the best course of action.
